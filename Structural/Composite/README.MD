# TV Show Playlist - Composite Pattern

## 📋 Overview

This project demonstrates the **Composite Design Pattern** using a TV show playlist system. The pattern allows you to treat individual episodes and collections of episodes (seasons) uniformly through the same interface. Just like how Netflix lets you click "Play" on either a single episode or an entire season with the same button!

## 🎯 Composite Pattern Explained

**Simple analogy:** Like a TV remote with a "PLAY" button that works whether you're playing one episode or an entire season. You don't need different buttons - the same button intelligently handles both single items and collections.

**What it does:** Treats individual objects (episodes) and groups of objects (seasons) the same way through a common interface.

**Key benefit:** Your code can handle single episodes and entire seasons with exactly the same methods - no need for different handling logic.

## 🏗️ Pattern Components

| Component | File | Role | Description |
|-----------|------|------|-------------|
| **Component** | `PlaylistComponent.java` | Common Interface | Defines operations both episodes and seasons can perform |
| **Leaf** | `Episode.java` | Individual Item | Single episode that contains actual content |
| **Composite** | `Season.java` | Collection | Season containing multiple episodes |
| **Client** | `PlaylistDemo.java` | The User | Shows how to use episodes and seasons uniformly |

## 📖 Expected Output

```
TV Show Playlist - Composite Pattern Demo
========================================

=== PLAYING INDIVIDUAL EPISODE ===
Playing episode: Pilot (45 mins)

=== PLAYING ENTIRE SEASON 1 ===
Playing season: Season 1
Total episodes: 3
Total duration: 147 minutes
--- Episodes ---
Playing episode: Pilot (45 mins)
Playing episode: The Dragon Reborn (50 mins)
Playing episode: A Place of Safety (52 mins)

=== PLAYING ENTIRE SEASON 2 ===
Playing season: Season 2
Total episodes: 3
Total duration: 144 minutes
--- Episodes ---
Playing episode: The Dragon Reborn Returns (48 mins)
Playing episode: Damane (47 mins)
Playing episode: Eyes Without Pity (49 mins)

=== COMPOSITE PATTERN MAGIC ===
Treating season and episode the same way:
Item 1 - Season 1 (147 mins total)
Item 2 - The Dragon Reborn (50 mins total)

Playing both items:
[Shows both season and individual episode playing with same method calls]

Composite Pattern Demo Complete!

## 🔍 The Composite Pattern Magic

### Tree Structure Visualization
```
Season 1 (Composite)
├── Episode 1: "Pilot" (Leaf)
├── Episode 2: "The Dragon Reborn" (Leaf)  
└── Episode 3: "A Place of Safety" (Leaf)

Season 2 (Composite)
├── Episode 4: "The Dragon Reborn Returns" (Leaf)
├── Episode 5: "Damane" (Leaf)
└── Episode 6: "Eyes Without Pity" (Leaf)
```

### The Magic Moment
```
User clicks "PLAY" on Episode:
Episode.play() → "Playing episode: Pilot (45 mins)"

User clicks "PLAY" on Season:
Season.play() → "Playing season: Season 1"
            → episode1.play() → "Playing episode: Pilot"
            → episode2.play() → "Playing episode: The Dragon Reborn"  
            → episode3.play() → "Playing episode: A Place of Safety"
```

## 🎯 Pattern Benefits Demonstrated

### 1. **Uniform Treatment**
```java
// Same method works for both episode and season!
PlaylistComponent episode = new Episode("Pilot", 45);
PlaylistComponent season = new Season("Season 1");

episode.play();  // Plays one episode
season.play();   // Plays all episodes in season
```

### 2. **Recursive Operations**
- When you play a season, it automatically plays all episodes inside
- When you get season duration, it automatically sums all episode durations
- Operations cascade down the tree structure naturally

### 3. **Tree Structure Support**
- Episodes are **leaf nodes** (contain actual content)
- Seasons are **composite nodes** (contain other components)
- Can easily extend to Series → Seasons → Episodes hierarchy

### 4. **Client Simplicity**
```java
// Client doesn't need to know if it's handling episode or season
private static void handlePlaylistItem(PlaylistComponent item) {
    System.out.println("Playing: " + item.getTitle());
    item.play(); // Same method call for both!
}
```

## 🌟 Real-World Applications

This same Composite pattern is used in:

- **Streaming Services**: Netflix (episodes, seasons, series), Spotify (songs, albums, playlists)
- **File Systems**: Windows Explorer, Mac Finder (files, folders, subfolders)
- **Organization Charts**: Companies (employees, departments, divisions)
- **GUI Applications**: UI components (buttons, panels, windows)
- **Document Structures**: Word processors (text, paragraphs, sections, documents)

## 🆚 Before vs After Composite Pattern

### Without Composite Pattern (Messy)
```java
if (userSelected instanceof Episode) {
    Episode ep = (Episode) userSelected;
    ep.playEpisode();
    System.out.println("Duration: " + ep.getEpisodeDuration());
} else if (userSelected instanceof Season) {
    Season season = (Season) userSelected;
    for (Episode ep : season.getEpisodes()) {
        ep.playEpisode();
    }
    System.out.println("Total duration: " + season.calculateTotalDuration());
}
// Different handling for each type! 😵
```

### With Composite Pattern (Clean)
```java
PlaylistComponent userSelected = getSelectedItem();
userSelected.play();                          // Works for both!
System.out.println("Duration: " + userSelected.getDuration()); // Works for both!
// Same handling regardless of type! 🎉
```

## 🔧 How to Extend

### Adding Series (Collection of Seasons)
```java
public class Series extends PlaylistComponent {
    private List<PlaylistComponent> seasons = new ArrayList<>();
    
    public void add(PlaylistComponent season) {
        seasons.add(season);
    }
    
    @Override
    public void play() {
        System.out.println("Playing series: " + getTitle());
        for (PlaylistComponent season : seasons) {
            season.play(); // Each season plays all its episodes!
        }
    }
    
    @Override
    public int getDuration() {
        int total = 0;
        for (PlaylistComponent season : seasons) {
            total += season.getDuration(); // Each season sums its episodes!
        }
        return total;
    }
}

// Usage - no changes needed to existing code!
Series gameOfThrones = new Series("Game of Thrones");
gameOfThrones.add(season1);
gameOfThrones.add(season2);
gameOfThrones.play(); // Plays entire series!
```

## 🚀 Key Composite Pattern Rules

### ✅ **Do This:**
```java
// Treat individual items and collections the same way
PlaylistComponent item = getSelectedItem(); // Could be episode or season
item.play(); // Same method call
```

### ❌ **Don't Do This:**
```java
// Different methods for different types
if (item instanceof Episode) {
    item.playEpisode();
} else {
    item.playSeason();
}
```

## 💡 Netflix Example

When you click "Play" on Netflix:

**On single episode:**
- Netflix plays that one episode (45 minutes)
- When done, suggests next episode

**On entire season:**  
- Netflix plays episode 1
- Auto-plays episode 2 when episode 1 ends
- Continues until entire season is watched
- Tracks total time as sum of all episodes

**Same "Play" button, intelligent behavior!** That's Composite Pattern in action.

## 🎯 Learning Takeaway

After running this demo, you should understand:
- How episodes (leaf) and seasons (composite) implement the same interface
- How operations automatically cascade down the tree structure  
- Why client code can treat individual items and collections uniformly
- How to build hierarchical structures that are easy to work with

## 💭 Remember

The Composite Pattern is like **Russian nesting dolls** - you can have:
- Doll inside doll inside doll (Episode → Season → Series)
- Same operations work at any level
- Open any level and find more levels or actual content

When you see tree-like structures where you want to treat **individual items** and **groups of items** the same way - that's where Composite Pattern shines! 🌳✨
